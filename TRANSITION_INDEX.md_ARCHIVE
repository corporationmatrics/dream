## 🗂️ File Archival Details

### **Where Old Files Are Stored**

```
_archive_OLD_DOCS/
├── KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md
├── SHADCN_UI_SETUP.md
├── MONGODB_INTEGRATION.md
├── OCR_INTEGRATION.md
├── PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md
├── ROADMAP.md
├── [... 33+ more old files ...]
└── README.md (explains this archive)
```

These are safe backups. You can restore individual files if needed:
```bash
# Example: Restore old Keycloak setup
cp _archive_OLD_DOCS/KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md ./KEYCLOAK_SETUP_OLD.md
```

### **Also Preserved**

The `_archive/` folder still contains historical project files (from earlier phases):
```
_archive/
├── 00_OCR_PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
├── DAY_2_UPDATE.md
├── DAY_3_UPDATE.md
├── [...historical files...]
```

These are kept for reference but are not current.

## 🚀 For New Team Members

### **Your Onboarding Path**

**Day 1:** Read all 5 files in order (2-3 hours)
```
1. 1_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md (45 min)     → Understand what, why, who
2. 2_SETUP_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md (60 min) → Set up your environment
3. 3_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (30 min) → Understand architecture
4. 4_DEVELOPER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (15 min) → Bookmark for daily use
5. 5_ROADMAP_AND_PHASES.md (20 min)   → Understand timeline
```

**Day 2:** Start developing
```
- Keep 4_DEVELOPER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md open
- Refer to 3_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for architecture
- Use commands from 2_SETUP_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md
- Check 1_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for status
```

**Week 1:** Dig deeper
```
- Read sections in detail
- Ask clarification questions
- Get familiar with codebase
