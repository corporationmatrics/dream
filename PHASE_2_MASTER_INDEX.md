## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM DOCUMENTATION

### What Makes Phase 2 Successful

```
✅ TECHNICAL:
  - JWT works end-to-end (signed, verified, expired properly)
  - Multi-tenant filtering automatic (middleware + queries)
  - Role guards enforce on backend (never trust frontend)
  - Password security maintained (bcrypt, never logged)
  - Performance acceptable (queries <2s, pages <3s)

✅ PRODUCT:
  - Users can register with their business
  - Users see role-appropriate UI
  - Admin can manage users & roles
  - Accounting features work
  - Data completely isolated by tenant

✅ PROCESS:
  - Feature-by-feature delivery (weekly)
  - Tests for each feature (manual + automated)
  - Code reviews before merge
  - Issues tracked & closure confirmed
  - Progress visible to stakeholders
```
