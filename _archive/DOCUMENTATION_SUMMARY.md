## 💬 FAQ

### Q: Why PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB?
**A:** PostgreSQL's JSONB support handles all document needs without operational complexity. Single database = simpler DevOps, better consistency.

### Q: Why BullMQ first, then Kafka?
**A:** BullMQ is simpler for MVP (5-min setup). Kafka adds complexity (30+ min setup) not needed until 10K+ orders/day. Migrate at Month 11.

### Q: Why NestJS for API, Spring Boot for accounting only?
**A:** NestJS is fast iteration (I/O-bound APIs). Spring Boot is memory-heavy but excellent for ACID transactions. Use selectively.

### Q: Can we skip Kubernetes initially?
**A:** Not recommended. Container orchestration from day 1 saves rework. Start with K3s (lightweight) or MicroK8s (local).

### Q: What if we need to scale faster?
**A:** Roadmap is conservative. You can compress phases if team grows and infrastructure is ready.

### Q: What if we need to pivot technology?
**A:** All technologies are industry-standard with large communities. Switching is possible but costly. Validate decisions early (POCs in Month 0).
